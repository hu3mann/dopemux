# 💊 DØPEMÜX — TERMINAL-FILTHY CONTEXT ENGINE

---

## 1. **Purpose & Core Mission**

* **Dopemux is a terminal-native, dopamine-maximal, forensic context engine.**
* **It’s built to rip, chunk, index, and replay memory from any creative/dev project**—so nothing is forgotten, no dopamine lost, and every creative thread can be picked up and run wild.
* It is both a developer dopamine engine and a context-forensic system for creative rituals, logging, and iterative invention.

### Key Objectives

* **Maximal Memory:** Everything important is captured, chunked, tagged, and replayable.
* **Dev Dopamine Rituals:** Minimize paperwork, maximize creative and engineering flow.
* **Forensic Auditability:** Every block, decision, and devlog is trackable and recoverable.
* **Composable Context:** Outputs are modular, schema-locked, and ready for downstream automation (LLMs, code agents, humans).
* **Terminal-Native, ADHD-Proof:** Designed to keep the most distractible developer or creative in the flow state.

---

## 2. **Core Benefits**

* **Total Context Recall:** Never lose a key idea, devlog, decision, dopamine hit, or blocker—ever.
* **Full Project Forensics:** Every change, override, and meta-decision is schema-logged and auditable.
* **Ritualized Dev/Creative Flow:** Encourages logging wins, blockers, and dopamine moments without breaking flow.
* **Automated Manifest Discipline:** No more stale docs—manifest and outputs are always up to date.
* **Downstream Ready:** Output is designed for agent pipelines, LLM automation, API ingestion, and future TUI/web dashboards.
* **Filthy Fun:** Roasts, snarks, and dopamine hits are part of the ritual. Serious system, not a serious face.

---

## 3. **Major Features**

### **3.1 Context Extraction & Chunking**

* **Ultraslicer:** Main extraction engine (see previous breakdown).
* Schema-locked chunking of any file, log, or chat into audit-ready blocks.

### **3.2 Schema Enforcement**

* All context, decisions, blockers, dopamine hits, and meta-logs are schema-locked.
* Schemas are versioned and pluggable; validation is strict.

### **3.3 Devlog Rituals**

* Every meaningful action, win, blocker, or override gets tracked.
* Devlogs are accessible, readable, and exportable for post-mortems or creative reviews.

### **3.4 Manifest Generation**

* Canonical `manifest.yaml` (or JSON) always in sync.
* Includes all project files, artifact state, block indices, session info, and compliance flags.

### **3.5 Terminal-First CLI**

* Dopemux runs in terminal or VS Code, with rich CLI tooling.
* Commands for extraction, manifest, devlog, autopatching, validation, and more.

### **3.6 TUI/Dashboard Ready (Planned)**

* Future text-based UI for navigating memory, blocks, and dopamine hits.
* Search, filter, time-travel, and export.

### **3.7 Agent Integration**

* Pluggable agent/LLM interface (e.g. via Langchain, OpenAI, custom code agents).
* Batch ops, multi-phase extraction, code-gen, prompt tuning, and agent-assisted decision trees.

### **3.8 Automation & CI/CD**

* Pre-commit hooks, auto-manifest/validation runners, GitOps native.
* Scripted autopatching, batch log extraction, and file updates.

* **Chunk:** Ultraslicer/Chunkasaurus splits into logical blocks.
* **Schema Map:** Each block is schema-locked with all required fields.
* **Tag & Log:** Everything is tagged, devlog entry created.
* **Output:** Modular block files (YAML/JSON), updated manifest, rolling devlog, and state dump.

### **4.2 Main Components**

* **Ultraslicer:** Core extraction/chunking engine.
* **Chunkasaurus:** Smart context windowing and chunk splitting.
* **Schema Engine:** Validates every output for compliance.
* **Devlog Writer:** Tracks wins, blockers, decisions, dopamine surges.
* **Manifest Generator:** Keeps canonical output up to date.
* **State Manager:** Tracks current project state for instant reload.

* **API/Agent Layer:** Handles external LLM, Langchain, or code agent integration.

### **4.3 Data Flows**

```plaintext
[Input: Log/Code/Chat] 
   → [Ultraslicer: Chunk] 
      → [Schema Engine: Validate] 
         → [Devlog Writer: Log Action] 
            → [Manifest Generator: Update] 
               → [Output: Blocks, Manifest, Devlog, State]
```

## 8. **Brand & Visual Identity**

### **8.1 Naming**

* **DØPEMÜX** (pronounced: “dope-mux”)—a riff on tmux, dopamine, and filthy rituals.
* **Modules:** Ultraslicer, Chunkasaurus, Dopemux Daemon, TFE-DEVLOG, etc.

### **8.2 Visual Style**

* **Aesthetic:** Terminal-native, filthy but modern.

  * Feels like hacking, but with designer dopamine.
  * Minimalist, clean code lines—juxtaposed with terminal filth and humor.
* **Logo/Iconography:**

  * Terminal block/cube with glowing edge, split or “sliced.”
  * Energy bolts, skulls, dopamine drops.
* **Color Scheme:**

  * **Primary:** Deep black, neon cyan, electric blue, mint green.
  * **Dopamine Hits:** Accents of gold or red for extreme moments.
* **Fonts:** Modern monospaced (JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Nerd Fonts).
