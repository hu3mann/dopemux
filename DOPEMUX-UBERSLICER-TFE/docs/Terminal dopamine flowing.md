## üëÅÔ∏è **What Are Agents?**
Agents are the living neurons, saboteurs, and dopamine demons running inside dopemux.  
Every one is **schema-locked**: tracked, logged, and never allowed to drift.

- **UltraSlicer** rips your context apart.
- **PatchDaemon** hunts entropy and force-patches drift.
- **DopamineGoblin** chases dopamine hits, logs every spike/block.
- **ManifestWarden** auto-generates, audits, and burns output drift to the ground.
- **UX-Scold**: Your workflow never safe from its roast.
- **DeadAgentBot**: The graveyard watcher.  
*Every agent is a terminal ritual‚Äîspawned, tracked, and (when dead) eulogized.*

---

## ‚ö°Ô∏è **How to Use This Directory**

1. **Spawn a New Agent:**  
   - Copy `/agents/agent-TEMPLATE.md`
   - Fill schema, drop into `/agents/`
   - Update `/agents/agents.md`

2. **Retire or Upgrade:**  
   - Update `/agents/agents.md` (Status, Last Update, Notes)
   - Move old agent file to `/agents/archive/` if needed
   - Log event in `/agents/log.md`

3. **Log Everything:**  
   - Births, deaths, upgrades go to `/agents/log.md`
   - Rituals & dopamine spikes? Log them or lose them.

4. **Autopsy or Audit:**  
   - Anyone should be able to understand agent roles, rituals, history, and quirks in <30 seconds.
   - If not? Scream at the DopamineGoblin until it‚Äôs fixed.

## üß¨ **Agent Anatomy**

Each agent lives in `/agents/agent-<agentname>.md`:

```yaml
agent: DopamineGoblin
role: Dopamine-sentry, ritual mood tracker
rituals:
  - Surface dopamine hits/blocks in logs
  - Annotate devlog with dopamine events
  - Trigger dopamine governance when flow drops
triggers:
  - On any major ideation, blocker, or dopamine loss
quirks:
  - Celebrates chaos, hates blandness
created: 2025-06-17
updated: 2025-06-17
retired: null
notes: Never lets a dopamine spike die unnoticed.

## üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è **Filthy Tips**

* **Don‚Äôt get precious.** Retire agents that drift or rot.
* **Never skip the log.** History is dopamine.
* **Upgrade the README** if your rituals change.
* **Steal these patterns** for any system that needs terminal dopamine.

# SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS & TERMINAL FILTH UPGRADES

* **Visual flair:** Add ASCII banners or tiny PNGs per agent for instant ID in a terminal-based UI.
* **Agent command map:** Each agent‚Äôs README could include common CLI invocations or triggers.
* **Live dopamine meter:** For each agent, append a ‚Äúdopamine level‚Äù tracker (manually, or with a plugin, until automated).
* **Auto-archive:** Write a script to move retired agent files to `/agents/archive/`.
* **Agent autopsy ritual:** Add a script or section for deep-diving dead/retired agents and recycling good habits.
* **Ritual audit trail:** `/agents/audit.md` with forensic-style logs for every significant change.
* **UX-Rage Mode:** Let UX-Scold inject roast banners into the terminal if memory/context loss exceeds threshold.
