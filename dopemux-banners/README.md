# Dopemux Banners

This folder contains terminal banners and roast lines for the Dopemux CLI.
Each banner lives in its own `.txt` file so scripts can rotate them easily.
Use `banner_loader.py` to display a random banner.

To package the banners run:

```bash
zip -r dopemux-banners.zip dopemux-banners
```

The zip is not stored in git to keep the repo text-only.
