### ⚡️ **Instructions** ⚡️

* **To use colors:**

  * Paste the banner into your file as shown, keep the ANSI escape codes.
  * For best results, `cat` or `bat` the file in a modern terminal with color support.
  * Use scripts to swap banner modes by symlink or by replacing banner files (e.g., `ln -sf /agents/banners/🧠-DopamineGoblin-BIOHACKER.txt /agents/banners/🧠-DopamineGoblin.txt`).

* **For even more filth:**

  * Change colors, add glitch effects, remix the text.
  * Add your own ASCII art for agent personalities.
  * Let me know your terminal emulator and I can max out compatibility/effects.
